Launch the graphical user interface to configure click-key binding, mouselook toggling,
and extra binding options. See context sensitive tooltips for detailed information.
Mouselook can be activated within the GUI or SWToR window area.
SMD requests elevated privilages in order to send click-binds to ToR as the latter
requires eleveted privilages itself. If elevation is denied SMD will run in GUI-only
mode.
